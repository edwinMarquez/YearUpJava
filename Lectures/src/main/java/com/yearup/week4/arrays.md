## Arrays 
* Arrays are a fundamental data structure in computer science. Arrays are statically allocated, contiguous blocks of memory that provide  access to data of a single type stored at a specified index. Most likely, you've encountered them before when learning how to program. Here is a refresher on what you should know about Arrays.
* new_address = start_address+i*data_size;

## ArrayLists

* An ArrayList is a wrapper for an array
* by default the capacity is 10
* Dynamically allocated in that the array is reallocated and copied when more space is necessary
* _Size_ is the number of data stored in it
* _capacity_ of the arrayList is the number of data that can be stored without a resize
